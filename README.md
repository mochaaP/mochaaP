<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ We're moving!</h2>

### tl;dr

- Legacy projects will be archived or stay in maintenance
mode
- New projects and new features will only be available on
new hosting platforms
- For end customers, as long as you are not using outdated
solutions, this will never affect you
- Contributions to other projects will continue on

I haven't pay GitHub for a cent in the past and I really
don't trust Microsoft that much on this thing.
Furthermore, due to the continuous abusement activities
happening on GitHub, it's really just a matter of time
for it to get down, in certain regions or for everyone.

Anyways, as for those (alive) personal projects, they
will be migrated to [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/).
I don't feel very comfortable presenting and promoting
you, audiences on GitHub, every bit of my warranty-less
software. I do open source for purely fun and hope they
can possibly help others, but the reality is I don't have
that much efforts to maintain all those things.

mochaaNetwork's infrastructure will be also migrated to
an on-premises private hosting service. Sorry if this
brings inconvenience. If you are a customer, this won't
affect you as an end user. We still have a great code
transparent policy, but please send inquiry to us first.

Thank you for your understanding!
