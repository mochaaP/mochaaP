<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ relocation notice</h2>

### tl;dr

- legacy projects are, well, legacy
- new projects won't be here
- contributions goes on

---

anyways, as for those (alive) personal projects, they
will be migrated to [sourcehut](https://sr.ht).
i don't feel very comfortable presenting and promoting
you, audiences on github, every bit of my warranty-less
software. i do open source for purely fun and hope they
can possibly help others, but the reality is i don't have
that much efforts to maintain all those things.

thank you for your understanding.
